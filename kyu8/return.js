This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

function multiply(a, b){
    return a * b
  }
  
  We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

  What ways of achieving this do you know?
  Examples (input --> output):
  
  123  --> "123"
  999  --> "999"
  -100 --> "-100"
  
  function numberToString(num) {
  
    return num.toString()
    
  }


  Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'
