You will be given an array and a limit value. You must check that all values in the array are below or equal to the limit value. If they are, return true. Else, return false.

You can assume all values in the array are numbers.

function smallEnough(a, limit){

    return a.every(e => e <= limit)
    
  }

  The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format [second oldest age,  oldest age].

The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.

For example (Input --> Output):

[1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]
[1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]
[1, 3, 10, 0]) --> [3, 10]


function twoOldestAges(ages){

    let newArr = ages.sort((a,b) => b-a)
    
    return [newArr[1], newArr[0]]
    
   };
