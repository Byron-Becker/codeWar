Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.


function sortByLength (array) {
    return array.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length);
  };


  The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1

10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

function gimme (triplet) {
  
    const midNum = triplet.slice().sort((a,b)=> a-b)[1]
    
    return triplet.indexOf(midNum)
    
  }
